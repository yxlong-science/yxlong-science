# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Yuexuan Long (é¾™è·ƒè½©)

Ph.D. student at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), working in [Long-Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/erping-long-lab/).

I study how stochasticity in gene expression shapes cellular states and human complex traits. My work integrates single-cell omics, genetics, and evolution, with an interest in bringing large language models (LLMs) into biomedicine.

## Research Interests
- Genetic features, heritability, and regulatory basis of gene expression noise
- Single-cell population genomics across disease and molecular trait
- Genomics and epigenomics to uncover principles of biological evolution
- Applying large language models to biomedicine and bioinformatics

## Current Focus
- Building robust frameworks to quantify and interpret gene expression noise
- Integrating single-cell and population-scale data to map genetic determinants of cellular variability
- Exploring LLM-driven knowledge extraction and tool development for biomedicine
